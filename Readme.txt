STATS Analysis (Nnaemeka).R contains the R code used for all objectives in Task 1:2. ASDV_DF_World_Bank_new.csv contains the pre-formatted dataset used in R script3. ASDV_DF_World_Bank_new_BI2.csv contain all data used for the dashboard building in Power BI4. MY ASDV BI.pbix is the Power BI dashboard.5. MY RAW DATASET.csv is the original data set downloaded from https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators?l=en#6. All libraries used within this project includes:1. tidyverse: is a collection of R packages designed for data science, including ggplot2 for data visualization, dplyr for data manipulation, tidyr for data tidying, and more. Promotes a consistent and tidy data structure for easier analysis.2. Hmisc: Provides various functions for statistical analysis and data manipulation. Includes tools for handling missing data, creating summary statistics, and developing regression models.3. corrplot: Specifically designed for visualizing correlation matrices. Allows users to create visually appealing correlation plots to explore relationships between variables.4. dplyr: A fundamental package for data manipulation, providing a set of functions (e.g., filter, mutate, summaries) that make data cleaning and transformation tasks more intuitive and efficient.5. Moments: Calculates various statistical moments, skewness, and kurtosis. Helps in exploring the shape and distribution of data.6. e1071: Includes functions for statistical modeling and machine learning, particularly known for its implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier and support vector machines.7. broom: Used for tidying model outputs. Takes the messy output of model functions and turns it into a tidy data frame, making it easier to work with in the tidyverse ecosystem.8. ggplot2: A powerful data visualization package based on the grammar of graphics. Allows users to create complex and customizable plots with a high degree of flexibility.9. purrr: Enhances and simplifies the process of applying functions to data structures. Provides a consistent and functional approach to iteration and mapping.10. datarium: Facilitates data analysis and exploration. Includes functions for cleaning data, transforming variables, and generating summary statistics.11. xts: Designed for handling time series data. Extends the capabilities of the zoo package and includes additional features for time-based analysis.12. forecast: Dedicated to time series forecasting. Provides various methods for forecasting, including exponential smoothing and ARIMA models.13. ggfortify: Extends ggplot2 to handle various statistical objects, such as time series, spatial data, and more. Allows users to use ggplot2 functionalities with different types of data.14. TTR: Provides technical analysis functions for financial time series data. Includes tools for calculating technical indicators commonly used in financial analysis.15. car: Offers various statistical tools for regression analysis. Includes functions for diagnostics, influence statistics, and advanced regression techniques.16. caret: Stands for Classification And Regression Training. A comprehensive package for machine learning, providing a consistent interface for model training, evaluation, and tuning.17. mgcv: Used for fitting generalized additive models (GAMs) and mixed-effects models. Extends the capabilities of the gam package and allows for flexible modeling of complex relationships.18. These libraries collectively cover a wide range of data analysis, visualization, statistical modeling, and machine learning tasks in the R programming language.
